## Introduction
The motivation behind writing this blog post is to reflect on the comparison between code-first and database-first approaches in backend development. This topic was recently explored in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/VzzvJSykBqs?si=FBpzoqDe2hF9hqew) titled "Application vs. Database: Who Actually Owns Your Data Model?" by IntelliJ IDEA YouTube Channel. The discussion in the video centers around the differing perspectives on whether the application logic or the database schema should take priority during development. While summarizing the key points discussed in this video, I aim to share my personal perspective and the practices I follow. As someone who does not use ORMs or automatic schema/migration generation tools, my preference for directly understanding and designing database schemas has influenced my bias toward the database-first approach.

## Summary of the Key Points Discussed in the Video
1. **Code-First Approach**:
    - The primary argument is that data models should be defined where they are consumed, which often means starting with application logic and letting the database schema be derived from this.
    - Code-first is seen as beneficial in the early stages of development because it allows faster iteration and flexibility. ORMs like Hibernate can auto-generate database schemas based on code changes, making it easy to adapt as the application evolves.
    - However, this approach can lead to inefficiencies in the database schema, such as suboptimal indexing or a lack of partitions, which could impact performance in the long term. Additionally, synchronizing database migrations can be complex when multiple developers make changes to the schema through the code.

2. **Database-First Approach**:
    - Advocates argue that starting with a carefully designed schema results in a more optimized and stable foundation for the application. This is particularly important for projects where the database will outlive individual application versions.
    - It is more suitable when a database is shared across multiple applications, as it ensures consistency and performance. The database schema becomes the single source of truth.
    - The downside is that it may feel rigid and less flexible during the early stages when the business logic is still evolving, requiring more effort to adapt the schema to new requirements.

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
    - Some suggest using code-first during the initial phases of development to leverage flexibility and then transitioning to a database-first approach when the data model stabilizes. This allows for rapid prototyping while ensuring long-term optimization.

## My Perspective
After watching the video and reflecting on my own experiences, I have a few thoughts on the comparison:

1. **On the Main Argument for Code-First**:
    - I don’t fully agree with the argument that data models should always be defined where they are consumed, as stated in support of the code-first approach. In my experience, application models can almost always be mapped to a well-designed database schema. Starting with a strong schema doesn't necessarily tie your hands when designing application models. Instead, it can provide a solid foundation that aligns with long-term data needs.

2. **Using Code-First Initially**:
    - I am not against the code-first approach during the early stages of development. In fact, I might favor it when the data model is still uncertain and evolving. During this phase, a strict, optimized schema might be premature, as frequent changes are expected. As long as production data isn’t at risk, code-first allows for rapid changes and adjustments without being bogged down by database migration management.
    - This approach helps avoid the trap of premature optimization, allowing teams to focus on refining the application's core functionality before committing to a more rigid schema design.

3. **The Strength of Database-First**:
    - Once the overall structure is stable, I find that switching to a database-first approach offers significant advantages. A well-designed schema gives confidence that the underlying data model can handle future business logic changes. It eliminates the worry of encountering unexpected limitations when implementing new features.
    - This stability means that changes at the application level can be made without constantly worrying about whether the database can support them. It helps to focus more on the application's business logic, knowing that the data layer is robust and reliable.

4. **Migrations and Collaborative Development**:
    - From my experience, managing database migrations is more straightforward when you have explicit control over the migration scripts rather than relying on auto-generated scripts. Knowing exactly what each migration does allows for better tracking of changes and ensures a smoother collaboration between team members.
    - A key part of successful migration management is maintaining a clear separation of concerns within the database schema. When possible, avoid splitting tasks that affect the same schema section among multiple developers. This approach minimizes the need to merge conflicting changes and instead focuses on managing the execution order of migration files.

## Conclusion: Data as the Source of Truth
In my opinion, data should ultimately be the source of truth in any application. The database schema and its migrations should be clean, well-organized, and ready to be used by any application logic. As emphasized in the video, data often outlives the application code, which makes having a solid database design crucial for the long-term success of a system. A well-designed schema ensures that the database remains a stable foundation even as the application evolves or changes over time.

By carefully balancing the flexibility of the code-first approach in the early stages with the stability of a database-first strategy later on, we can build applications that are both adaptable and resilient. This approach allows us to focus on what matters most: delivering a reliable and scalable product.
